# -Banking-System-Management-
This Python script simulates a basic banking system management, differentiating between agents and clients. Agents can add or delete accounts, while clients can perform various account-related operations such as changing passwords, checking balances, depositing money, and withdrawing money.

For agents (Q=2):

Option 1 allows an agent to add a new client account with a randomly generated account number, password, and initial balance.
Option 2 enables an agent to delete a client account, removing it from the accounts and client records.
For clients (Q=1):

Option 1 lets a client change their password by entering the old password and specifying a new one.
Option 2 displays the account balance for a given account number.
Option 3 allows a client to deposit money into their account.
Option 4 enables a client to withdraw money from their account.
The script uses dictionaries to store information about accounts, clients, and the association between clients and their accounts. Overall, it provides a simplified illustration of a banking system with basic functionalities.
